                    You know, sometimes I really wonder how we even work. You and I… we’re so different. The way you look at life, the way you chase your career, the way your brain works as a software engineer—it’s a whole different world from mine. And honestly, half the time I have no clue about your world.<br><br>
                    But still… here I am, trying. Trying to step into your comfort zone, trying to stretch my own comfort zone, just to do something that feels a little like you. Maybe I’ll mess it up, maybe it won’t make sense, but it’s my way of saying—I care enough to try.<br><br>
                    I guess that’s the thing about us, right? Different, but somehow still finding a way. And Vivek, I don’t know if you’ll even be able to read this little “engineering-style” letter of mine, but I hope you’ll feel the heart behind it.<br><br>
                    So let me just ask you… will you take this weird little girl, with all her clumsy efforts and her not-so-perfect ways, and risk your life with her—just like you’ve risked giving me the last two years of your life?<br><br>
                    Because truthfully… I’d love nothing more than to be your partner for the rest of my life.<br><br>
                    Always yours,<br>
                    Disha ❤️
